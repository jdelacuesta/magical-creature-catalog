# magical-creature-catalog

**Overview**

This assignment is a Swift Playground file that implements a Magical Creature Catalog, showcasing various mythical creatures and their abilities. The catalog includes:

	•	A Creature struct with properties like name, description, alignment, and magic power.
	•	A Fibonacci-based ability system, where a creature’s ability is determined by its magic power.
	•	A collection of creatures stored in an array.
	•	An interaction system, where creatures interact based on their alignment (good vs. evil).

**Features**

✅ Struct-Based Creature Definitions – Unicorns, Dragons, and Phoenixes all with unique properties.

✅ Fibonacci Ability Calculation – A creature’s ability is tied to its magic power.

✅ Interaction Mechanism – Determines how creatures interact based on their inner nature.

✅ Readable Output – A function prints details about each creature and their interactions.
